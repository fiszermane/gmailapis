# Gmail API Samples
Simple Gmail APIs with Python

# Few samples ready to retrieve
- Number of emails in a label
- Number of threads in a label

# Authentication
I found it very easy to run a small piece of code in my local computer.
This way, with a link, it will lead to a Browser which you can authenticate and will generate a token.pickle file. You can then upload that one to the cloud. I found it much easier than learning how to work with other authentication protocols in the Gmail API stack like OAUTH2.0.
